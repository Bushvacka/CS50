I based my initial model off of the "digits" network shown in the lecture, as both problems take an input image and assign it a category. This original model was made up of a convolutional layer, a max pool layer, a dense hidden layer with dropout, and the output layer. I began by adding more hidden dense layers, which gave little result. Instead, I added more convolutional and pooling layers, stopping at 3 after recieving an error regarding 'negative dimensions' (I assume the image shape got too small to pool?). By this point, my training accuracy was increasing fast, but the results were not being mirrored by the testing data. Increasing the dropout on the hidden layers to 25% solved this problem. I briefly experimented with adding dropout to the convolutional layers, but saw little change. Finally, I modified the learning rate and decay of the optimizer till I found values that worked best. Some things I tried that didn't work were changing the activation functions or the loss calculation (ReLU/Softmax and 'categorical_crossentropy' respectively)
